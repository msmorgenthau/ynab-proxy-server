# üéØ Updated Deployment Instructions

Based on what I found, you have an existing forked TypingMind plugins server. Here are your options:

## Option A: Add YNAB to Your Existing Server (Recommended)

Since you already have `plugins-server-forked` connected to `https://github.com/msmorgenthau/typingmind-plugins-server.git`, you can add YNAB support to it:

### 1. Create YNAB Route File
```bash
cd /Users/michaelmorgenthau/plugins-server-forked/src/routes
mkdir -p ynab
```

### 2. I'll create the TypeScript route for you:

```typescript
// Save this as: /Users/michaelmorgenthau/plugins-server-forked/src/routes/ynab/ynabRouter.ts
```

Actually, this would be more complex since we'd need to adapt our JavaScript proxy to TypeScript and integrate with their existing structure.

## Option B: Deploy Standalone YNAB Proxy (Simpler) ‚úÖ

This is what I recommend - deploy the YNAB proxy as a separate service:

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
```bash
cd /Users/michaelmorgenthau/ynab-proxy-server

# Create a new repo on GitHub first (github.com/new)
# Name it: "ynab-proxy-server"
# Then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/msmorgenthau/ynab-proxy-server.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Deploy on Render
1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Click "New +" ‚Üí "Web Service"
3. Connect to your new `ynab-proxy-server` repository
4. Configure:
   - Name: `ynab-proxy`
   - Region: Same as your current service
   - Branch: `main`
   - Runtime: `Node`
   - Build Command: `npm install`
   - Start Command: `npm start`
5. Click "Create Web Service"

### 3. Update TypingMind Plugin
Once deployed, update your plugin to use:
```
https://ynab-proxy.onrender.com
```
Instead of:
```
https://plugins-server-7x3r.onrender.com
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note
I noticed your git remote contains an access token. You might want to:
```bash
cd /Users/michaelmorgenthau/plugins-server-forked
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/msmorgenthau/typingmind-plugins-server.git
```

## What's Next?

The standalone YNAB proxy is ready to deploy. It's simpler than modifying the TypeScript plugins server and will be easier to maintain.

Your files are ready at:
`/Users/michaelmorgenthau/ynab-proxy-server/`

Just create the GitHub repo and push!
